# **Introduction**

From my research by seeking news about social environmental issues in Vietnam, I have an idea to create an Environmental Condition Monitoring Website focusing on air pollution, particularly with fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels rising up to 3.5 times. "In 2023, statistics indicate that more than 62 million people live in rural areas, accounting for nearly 62 percent of the national population." Quoted from [Vietnamnews.vn](https://vietnamnews.vn/society/1690457/many-rural-areas-suffer-severe-air-pollution.html) Many rural areas are experiencing severe air pollution. This is very concerning because air, which is an essential part of life, must not be polluted as it can cause diseases for anyone who breathes it in excessively.

# **Problem Statement**

In addition, the city of Hà Nội is facing very serious air quality problems. Hà Nội ranks at the top of the list of cities with the worst air pollution in the world, with air quality reaching purple level, which is classified as 'Very Unhealthy'. According to the IQAir air quality monitoring system, at 8:04 AM on Tuesday, [Air Quality (AQI) Hà Nội](https://vietnamnews.vn/environment/1690054/air-quality-in-ha-noi-worst-in-the-world-today.html) Hà Nội in Hà Nội recorded a figure of 272.

With the poor air quality conditions there, news from Vietnam reported that Hà Nội requires comprehensive emissions data to develop an effective air pollution control plan. From this, I have the idea to create an air quality detector for everyone who wants to know the air quality around their residence. However, this time we will narrow our focus to the countries of Vietnam and Indonesia first, as Indonesia has also experienced similar issues as those faced by Vietnam.

# **Website Features**

To create a website that can provide information about environmental conditions there with data visualization through graphs and interactive maps, allowing users to better understand the conditions in their environment through engaging and easy-to-understand data presentations.

![workflow](/workflow.png)

this is an overview of my workflow how my website can run and this is just the beginning and can still be added several more features such as notifications to user devices which will be more helpful. 

# **User Accessibility**

This website will be created as permissionless so that access can be reached by all groups. However, to access features such as notifications and reporting forms, you will need to register your email first.

But don't worry, the email linked will only be used to send notifications.

# **Technical Implementation**

And for the creation of this website, I think I will try to make it in a native web form if possible, so I will create it with frameworks that allow it, such as Bootstrap and others For data search or data collection, we will use data from [IQAir](https://www.iqair.com/world-air-quality-ranking?srsltid=AfmBOorLTiT88mpLbP8fCh_0R1WhqqnypxGKqHNta4IRFMM3IRBKrE2a),[OpenAQ](https://openaq.org/) or API from [WAQI](https://aqicn.org/api/).

# **Future Enhancements**

For additional features, we are highly likely to add them in the future to enhance the usefulness of this website and to meet the needs of many users who want to know the state of their air quality.

# **Conclusion**

With the poor air quality conditions, it is very important to be aware of it so that we can prepare ourselves and make good decisions to avoid excessive outdoor activities, even if the external conditions seem fine. The air quality may not be good. To address this, we will create an air quality information website so that users can understand what is happening with the air quality around them.
